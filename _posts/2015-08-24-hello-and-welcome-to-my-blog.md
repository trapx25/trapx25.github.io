This is a place where I will discuss solutions to any challenges that I encounter while making web applications. It will also serve as a place for me to talk about more abstract Computer Science topics that I learn in school. From time to time, you may stumble across a random topic or two about fitness or movie reviews.

My mission in writing about these topics is to offer beginners a chance to learn with me while I try to improve my own understanding. I will aim to explain advanced concepts in a very straightforward manner. Since I am a beginner myself, I believe my posts will be more relatable to the beginner audience than some of the content that's already out there.

Caveat emptor: by no means am I an expert on any of the topics I talk about. This blog is not trying to target senior programmers. It is not a high-level analysis on what programmers should be doing. I will not advocate for any specific framework or set of architectures, but I will explain how some of them work to the best of my ability.

I suppose this blog could also be considered a documentation of a beginning developer's journey.
